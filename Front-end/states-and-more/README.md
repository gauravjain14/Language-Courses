So, a couple of things I have learnt in this module - 

1. more useState() - sharing an instance of useState() between components which is pretty cool.
    Now I know how lists are automatically filtered as I am updating the input text.

2. props.children - Anything between the <> </> tags is passed as props.children to the component.
    This is very useful to capture any and all text between the tags
