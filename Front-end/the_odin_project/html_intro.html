        <h1>Well, here I am, learning front-end.</h1>
        <p>Starting on <strong>17th April 2025</strong>, let's see how far I go.</p>
        <p>Tools I am planning to have learnt by the end of this course
            are <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</em></p>

        <p>As I move forward, I can use this to remember a bunch of unnecessary things
            including groceries I need to buy today - 
            <ul>
                <li>Cream Cheese</li>
                <li>Ground Coffee</li>
                <li>Beer</li>
                <li>Chobani</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
